# nodeServer
My First NodeJS Server

Here's a simple nodejs server using express

# How to set it up

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/majraoruc/nodeServer.git
2. Open in VS Code or any other editor of your choice (I prefer VSCode)
3. ``` bash npm install  ```
4. ``` bash npm start  ```

All there's left to do is to open your local host at port 5000 and check things out
[LOCAL HOST](http://localhost:5000)
